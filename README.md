# Contact Book

This is a simple Contact Book application built with Python using Tkinter for the graphical user interface and MySQL for the database. The application allows users to register, login, create, view, edit, and delete their own contacts. This is my first project and serves as an introduction to GUI programming and database integration.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register with a unique username and password.
- **User Login**: Authenticates users and provides access to their contacts.
- **Create Contact**: Users can add new contacts with details like first name, last name, phone number, address, and email.
- **View Contacts**: Users can view all their saved contacts.
- **Edit Contact**: Users can update the details of their existing contacts.
- **Delete Contact**: Users can remove contacts from their contact book.
- **User Authentication**: Ensures that only the authenticated user can manage their contacts.
